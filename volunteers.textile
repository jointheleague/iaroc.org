h2. Become a Volunteer

For any event to succeed, people must be in place to make things happen. Although we are working to organizing this event, there are not enough of us in the organizing committee to make this happen.

Please sign up to help us with various work that will need to get done

* Setup
* Coordinating "Order of Running"
* Time Keepers
* Score keepers
* Teardown

Even if you can only come for a few hours, sign up, the more the merrier.
